Synopsis

    parallel -h
    parallel $count < $jobfile

Description

    `parallel` reads a list of job descriptions, and runs at most
    $count of them in parallel.

    If $count is not given, `parallel` tries to use the environment
    variable `PARALLEL`, the value returned from sysconf(3) for online
    processors, or the hard-wired default 4, in that order.

    A job description is a single line, which is split into words and
    then fed to execvp(3).  Single and double quoting are supported,
    the latter understanding the following escape sequences:

        \n - newline
        \t - tabstop
        \\ - backslash
        \" - double quote.

    An unquoted backslash quotes the following character, as known
    from the shell.

Example

    The following `bash` snippet generates smaller versions of all
    JPEG files in the current directory, using GraphicsMagick `gm
    convert`

        ls *.jpeg |
        sed -r "s/.*/gm convert '&' -resize 300x200 'small-&'/" |
        parallel

    The `sed` command is used to create job descriptions from the
    listing provided by `ls`.  An alternative to the same end:

        for i in *.jpeg; do
            echo "gm convert '$i' -resize 300x200 'small-$i'";
        done | parallel
